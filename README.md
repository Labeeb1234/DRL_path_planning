# Reinforcement Learning Based Path Planning on Mobile Robots

- So this project is basically something I do in my off time. Started off by trying to learn DRL based path planning on robots.
- Picked a 4 wheeled omni bot for this project, created an custom gym env after the entire kinematics model was modularized for this bot.

## ========================================================================================================
## An RL developer module specifically for 4wheeled-OmniBot using python (just for fun 😐, got sidetracked)  --> started off as a combined offshoot of a another project involving standard robotics path planning involving the normal search-based and probabilistic based path planning. Thought of testing RL on the side and now keep a separate repo for tracking and saving progress right here

- Here is a working demo of a sample multi-bot environment

- The module is still subject to changes and is a bit unpolished
