# Reinforcement Learning Based Path Planning on Mobile Robots

- So this project is basically something I do in my off time. Started off by trying to learn DRL based path planning on robots.
- Picked a 4 wheeled omni bot for this project, created an custom gym env after the entire kinematics model was modularized for this bot.
